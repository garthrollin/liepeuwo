Hello, suddenly one of my MyBook exposes SMART warning C5 Current Pending Sector Count - 200 / 200 / 0 / 1 Is this dangerous warning? Is the drive going to die soon? Can I fix it somehow. Hello, I have a HDD that shows a SMART C5 Current Pending Sector Count warning. The C5 warning appeared more than a year ago and hasn't increased since. Recently, I tried to clone the HDD to a smaller SSD using Macrium Reflect, to no avail. Macrium aborted on the Pending Sectors. I ran chkdsk /r on the drive, and after that, Macrium aborted again. Has anyone successfully used EaseUS Partition Master to fix the C5 Pending Sector Count, like described here? https://www.easeus.com/partition. How to fix (C5) Current Pending Sector Count warning. for the past months and just this week blue screen appeared during start up (i think due to shutdown not fully offed my desktop before turning off the switch cable), And right now i managed to get it on to my homescreen by doing chkdsk but not fully completing it, only at stage 4, right now i managed to backup my movies (550GB) and several files to my friends external hdd. And as of right now it says it's in caution from crystaldisk and yellow in reallocated sectors count, current and uncorre.

"Current Pending Sector" is a direct indication of the number of bad sectors waiting to be remapped ( remapping is the process of marking defective sectors are bad and allocating spare sectors from the reserved pool as replacement "Logical Blocks". Hello there, months ago i purchased an HP notebook and it was really nice! but two months ago it saw a decrease in overall performance and longer boot time, even after two resets (formatting and installing from zero). i ran all the antimalware solutions from the sticky post, and ran a crystal disk info (but idk how to read it, so i will paste it below), killed a few services that i heard were causing performance issues on windows 10 (like superfecth and search). i will be very grateful

This is my second post in less than two weeks. I just finished installing a new hard drive into my desktop but it's apparently reporting low disk speeds according to Defraggler. (imgur link below) Also, CrystalDiskInfo reports caution with the same drive.

Adicione aos favoritos, comente Sometimes during read/write tasks my HDD (ST1000LM014) starts to click with a soft fast sound (the repetition rate of clicks is around 5 Hz). It usually stays clicking for around 30 seconds, during which all read/write speeds go to zero (media playback freezes, file transfer pauses.) and disk usage in taskmgr bumps to clean 100%. It doesn't sound like the usual 'click of death', mine is faster and quieter (at first I thought it was a fan blade hitting some loose cable/foam). The noise is barel. 
Current Pending Sector Count S.M.A.R.T. parameter is a critical parameter and indicates the current count of unstable sectors (waiting for remapping). I have a Plex box that is having issues.
